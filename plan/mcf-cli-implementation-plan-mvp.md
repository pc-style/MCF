# MCF CLI Phased Implementation Plan - MVP

**Last Updated**: 2025-08-31

> **Transient Document**: Implementation plans created from this template are temporary working documents used to guide specific development increments or phases. Unlike living documents, they have defined lifespans tied to their implementation cycles.
>
> **Purpose**: Provides a structured roadmap for implementing the product based on the product specification and technical architecture. Serves as a progress tracker and development guide for AI assistants and development teams during active development.
>
> **Lifecycle**: Once an implementation is complete, the plan document can be archived for historical reference or discarded. It is not intended to be continuously maintained beyond the completion of its associated development phase.
>
> **Maintenance**: During the implementation of this plan AI assistants should update progress status, mark completed tasks.

## Instructions for AI Assistants

When working with this implementation plan:

**Filename Format**: Save implementation plans using the format `mcf-cli-implementation-plan-mvp.md` (lowercase with hyphens, include version identifier like MVP, v1, v2, etc.)

1. **Task & Progress Management**:
   - Update task status (Not Started ‚Üí In Progress ‚Üí Completed ‚Üí Blocked)
   - Mark completion dates and add review notes
   - Update "Last Updated" date when making changes
   - Update phase completion percentages and overall project status
   - Add new tasks if scope expands or requirements emerge

2. **Technical Requirements**:
   - Document critical technical requirements, constraints, and build verification criteria
   - Note mandatory review points with stakeholders

3. **Mandatory Reading Requirement**:
   - **BEFORE ANY IMPLEMENTATION**: Read ALL documents in "MANDATORY Pre-Implementation Reading" section
   - Verify understanding of patterns, standards, and architectural constraints
   - Confirm with human before proceeding with implementation work
   - This reading is required at the START of every conversation involving this implementation

4. **UCM Component Integration Strategy**:
   - **UCM Reference Format**: Use `ucm:` prefix for all UCM artifacts (e.g., `ucm:utaba/main/patterns/micro-block/README.md`)
   - **Import vs Build**: Tasks must clearly specify if components should be imported from UCM using the `ucm:` prefix
   - **Discovery Requirement**: Before creating implementation tasks, search UCM for existing components
   - **Never Recreate**: If a UCM component exists that meets requirements, always import rather than build from scratch

5. **Mandatory Pre-Implementation Tasks**:
   - **EVERY PHASE** must begin with Task X.0: "Pre-Implementation: Mandatory Reading Verification"
   - **FORBIDDEN**: Starting any implementation tasks (X.1, X.2, etc.) until Task X.0 is completed
   - Task X.0 forces verification that all mandatory reading has been completed

6. **Mandatory Post-Implementation Task**:
   - **EVERY PHASE** must end with Task X.99: "Post-Implementation: Plan Update & Status Review"
   - **FORBIDDEN**: Stopping work or asking user to proceed without completing Task X.99
   - This task forces update of implementation plan status, progress percentages, and completed deliverables
   - Must update "Current Progress Status" section and mark phase completion
   - **REQUIRED WHENEVER STOPPING**: Even if stopping mid-phase, must complete Task X.99 to document current state

7. **Cross-References**:
   - Reference product specification features being implemented
   - Link to technical architecture decisions
   - Include relevant external documentation

8. **Workflow**:
   - Complete all tasks within a phase before proceeding
   - Update this document with completed tasks and review notes
   - **STOP at the end of each phase and ask the user to proceed**
   - Wait for explicit user approval before starting the next phase
   - This ensures stakeholder alignment and allows for plan adjustments between phases

### Required Reading List

| Document Type         | Location                                                             | Description                                             | Must Read Before                 |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |

### AI Assistant Instructions

**BEFORE implementing ANYTHING in this project:**

1. **‚úÖ MANDATORY**: Read ALL documents listed above in the "Required Reading List"
2. **‚úÖ MANDATORY**: Confirm understanding of patterns, standards, and architectural constraints
3. **‚úÖ MANDATORY**: Ask the human: "I have reviewed the required documentation. Should I proceed with implementation?"
4. **‚ùå FORBIDDEN**: Starting any implementation work without completing the required reading

**Reading Verification**: When starting a new conversation about this implementation, AI assistants must state:

> "I am reviewing the mandatory pre-implementation reading list: [list document paths]. I will read these before proceeding with any implementation work."

## üîç UCM Component Integration Guidelines

### UCM Reference Format

**All UCM artifacts must use the `ucm:` prefix to distinguish them from file system components:**

**Examples**:

- `ucm:utaba/main/patterns/micro-block/README.md`
- `ucm:utaba/main/commands/micro-block/BaseCommand.ts`
- `ucm:utaba/main/services/micro-block/ServiceRegistry.ts`

### Task Creation Guidelines

When creating implementation tasks, explicitly specify UCM imports:

**‚úÖ CORRECT Task Format**:

```
Task 2.3: Implement Configuration Service
Requirements:
- Import base service pattern from ucm:utaba/main/patterns/micro-block/BaseService.ts
- Import configuration utilities from ucm:utaba/main/services/configuration/ConfigService.ts
- Build ConfigurationService extending BaseService pattern
- Implement profile save, load, list, and delete methods
```

### Discovery & Planning Process

1. **Before creating tasks**: Search UCM for relevant components
2. **Document UCM components**: List all applicable UCM artifacts using `ucm:` prefix
3. **Plan imports**: Specify exactly which UCM components will be imported in each task
4. **Plan builds**: Only plan to build components that don't exist in UCM

## üö® Critical Development Requirements üö®

### Micro-Block Architecture Compliance

**All commands and services MUST follow micro-block patterns from UCM**

- ‚ùå **FORBIDDEN**: Direct command instantiation (`new MyCommand()`)
- ‚úÖ **REQUIRED**: Registry-based command access via ServiceRegistry
- **ALL COMMANDS** must declare dependencies in metadata
- **ALL SERVICES** must use own configuration interfaces

### Node.js CLI Specific Requirements

**Native Node.js implementation replacing bash scripts**

- **NO BASH SCRIPTS** anywhere except for shell integration helpers
- **ALL FUNCTIONALITY** MUST be implemented in JavaScript/Node.js
- **NO DEPENDENCIES** on external bash/Python scripts

### Build Verification Requirement

**MANDATORY: Every implementation task MUST end with a successful build verification.**

- ‚úÖ **REQUIRED**: Run `npm test` after completing any implementation work
- ‚úÖ **REQUIRED**: Ensure `node bin/mcf.js --help` succeeds with zero errors
- ‚úÖ **REQUIRED**: Fix any TypeScript/ESLint errors before marking tasks complete
- ‚ùå **FORBIDDEN**: Completing tasks with failing tests or linting errors

**Implementation Process**:

1. Complete implementation work
2. Run `npm test` to verify functionality
3. Fix any test failures that arise
4. Run linting/type checking if configured
5. Only then mark task as complete

| 3.99    | **Post-Implementation: Plan Update & Status Review**   | **MANDATORY**: Update implementation plan status and progress percentages, mark completed tasks and deliverables, update "Current Progress Status" section, document phase completion or current stopping point                        | Not Started |                | **REQUIRED**: Must complete before stopping work or asking user to proceed |

**Deliverables**:

- Claude Code integration with flag pass-through
- MCP server management system
- Self-contained installation process
- Comprehensive status monitoring
- Shell integration and PATH configuration

## Notes

- All components must follow micro-block architecture patterns from UCM
- Configuration profiles must support environment variables and Claude Code settings
- Installation process must be completely self-contained (no bash script dependencies)
- Cross-platform compatibility is essential for macOS, Linux, and Windows
- Performance target: sub-second execution for status and config commands
