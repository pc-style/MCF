## 3. Code Context

### Important Code Implementations

**Micro-Block Architecture (cli/lib/core/):**

- Registry pattern with singleton ServiceRegistry for DI
- Contract-first design with rich metadata interfaces
- BaseService and BaseCommand abstractions for consistent patterns

**Service Layer (cli/lib/services/):**

- **ClaudeService**: Direct CLI integration with process management at `cli/lib/services/implementations/ClaudeService.js`
- **ConfigurationService**: Profile management with validation at `cli/lib/services/implementations/ConfigurationService.js`
- **MCPService**: Server lifecycle management at `cli/lib/services/implementations/MCPService.js`
- **ProjectService**: Workspace management at `cli/lib/services/implementations/ProjectService.js`

**Command Layer (cli/lib/commands/):**

- **RunCommand**: Claude integration with flag parsing at `cli/lib/commands/run/RunCommand.js`
- **ConfigCommand**: Profile CRUD operations at `cli/lib/commands/config/ConfigCommand.js`
- **MCPCommand**: Server management at `cli/lib/commands/mcp/MCPCommand.js`
- **ProjectCommand**: Project lifecycle at `cli/lib/commands/project/ProjectCommand.js`

### Architecture Decisions

- **ES Modules**: Native ES module support throughout codebase
- **TypeScript Dual Compilation**: .ts and .js files for Node.js compatibility
- **Registry-Driven Composition**: No direct instantiation, all through registries
- **JSON Configuration**: Profile-based configuration with validation
- **Process Management**: Child process integration for Claude Code and MCP servers

### Security Implementations

- Input validation and sanitization for shell commands
- Configuration file permissions (600 for sensitive data)
- Process sandboxing for child processes
- Environment variable isolation per profile

### Performance Optimizations

- Lazy loading of commands and services
- Singleton pattern for registry management
- Caching of configuration and project state
- Parallel processing for installation tasks

## 4. Project Knowledge

### Lessons Learned

- **Micro-Block Adaptation**: Successfully adapted web-focused micro-block patterns for CLI applications
- **Registry Benefits**: Dependency injection through registries provides excellent testability and modularity
- **Configuration Management**: JSON-based profiles with validation provide flexibility while maintaining structure
- **Process Integration**: Child process management enables seamless integration with existing CLI tools

### Solutions Implemented

- **CLI Architecture**: Solved complex command composition through registry pattern
- **Configuration Profiles**: Addressed environment isolation with profile system
- **MCP Integration**: Built comprehensive server lifecycle management
- **Claude Integration**: Created direct CLI pass-through with argument parsing

### Best Practices Identified
