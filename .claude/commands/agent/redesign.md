## Multi-Agent System Redesign

**Redesign Target:** $ARGUMENTS

**Gemini MCP Support**: This command has access to Gemini MCP tools for advanced analysis, brainstorming, and efficient problem solving to save context usage.


Execute comprehensive system redesign using specialized agents for optimal architecture and implementation:

### 1. **Redesign Analysis Team**

**Core Agents:**
- **semantic-navigator**: Deep codebase understanding and current architecture analysis
- **micro-analyzer**: Detailed component analysis and dependency mapping
- **api-designer**: Interface redesign and data flow optimization
- **perf-optimizer**: Performance impact assessment and optimization planning

**Specialized Agents (as needed):**
- **security-auditor**: Security implications and vulnerability prevention
- **devops-engineer**: Deployment and infrastructure considerations
- **docs-researcher**: Best practices and modern design patterns

### 2. **Redesign Methodology**

**Phase 1: Current State Analysis**
- Architecture assessment using Serena semantic tools
- Component dependency mapping and coupling analysis
- Performance bottleneck identification
- Technical debt assessment and impact analysis
- User experience and workflow analysis

**Phase 2: Design Vision & Planning**
- Modern architecture pattern research and selection
- Component redesign and interface optimization
- Data flow and state management improvements
- Scalability and maintainability enhancements
- Integration strategy and migration planning

**Phase 3: Implementation & Validation**
- Prototype development and testing
- Performance benchmarking and optimization
- Security validation and testing
- User acceptance testing and feedback
- Documentation and training materials

### 3. **Redesign Focus Areas**

**Architecture Redesign:**
- System decomposition and component boundaries
- Data flow and communication patterns
- Scalability and performance architecture
- Security and access control design

**Component Redesign:**
- Interface definitions and contracts
- Data models and state management
- Error handling and resilience patterns
- Testing and validation strategies

**Workflow Redesign:**
- User interaction flows and experience
- Business process optimization
- Integration patterns and APIs
- Monitoring and observability

### 4. **Design Principles & Constraints**

**Modern Design Principles:**
- Microservices and modular architecture
- Event-driven and reactive patterns
- API-first design and contract-first development
- Security by design and defense in depth
- Performance and scalability optimization

**Technical Constraints:**
- Existing technology stack compatibility
- Migration complexity and risk assessment
- Resource requirements and timeline
- Team expertise and learning curve
- Business continuity requirements

### 5. **Redesign Deliverables**

- **Migration Roadmap**: Step-by-step transition plan
- **Implementation Guide**: Development and testing procedures
- **Risk Assessment**: Potential issues and mitigation strategies
- **Success Metrics**: How to measure redesign success
- **Training Materials**: Team education and onboarding

### 6. **Validation & Iteration**

- **Design Review**: Stakeholder feedback and approval
- **Prototype Testing**: Proof of concept validation
- **Performance Validation**: Benchmarking and optimization
- **Security Review**: Vulnerability assessment and remediation
- **User Testing**: Experience validation and feedback

### 7. **Implementation Strategy**

- **Phased Rollout**: Incremental implementation and validation
- **Feature Flags**: Gradual feature enablement and testing
- **Rollback Plan**: Emergency reversion procedures
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive observability and alerting
- **Documentation**: Complete system documentation and guides
