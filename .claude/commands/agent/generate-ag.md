## Project-Specific Agent Generation

**Request:** $ARGUMENTS

Generate new specialized agents specifically designed for your current project's needs:

### 1. **Project Analysis Phase**

**Agent Team:**
- **micro-analyzer**: Deep codebase analysis using Serena semantic tools
- **semantic-navigator**: Project structure and architectural pattern identification
- **docs-researcher**: Research best practices for similar project types

### 2. **Agent Generation Strategy**

**Step 1: Codebase Profiling**
- Language and framework analysis
- Architecture pattern identification
- Common development workflows
- Pain points and bottlenecks
- Testing and deployment patterns

**Step 2: Agent Requirements Analysis**
- Identify missing specialized capabilities
- Determine optimal agent combinations
- Define project-specific tool requirements
- Plan integration with existing agents

**Step 3: Custom Agent Creation**
- Generate agent definitions with project-specific tools
- Create specialized workflows and patterns
- Define project context and memories
- Optimize for current development patterns

### 3. **Generated Agent Types**

**Common Project-Specific Agents:**
- **Project Architect**: Specialized in your specific architecture patterns
- **Framework Expert**: Deep knowledge of your tech stack
- **Testing Specialist**: Tailored to your testing framework and patterns
- **Deployment Engineer**: Optimized for your deployment pipeline
- **Domain Expert**: Understanding of your business logic and data models

### 4. **Customization Process**

1. **Analysis Questions**: Ask clarifying questions about your development workflow
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Identify recurring development patterns
3. **Tool Selection**: Choose optimal tools for your specific needs
4. **Integration Planning**: Plan how new agents work with existing ones
5. **Validation**: Test generated agents with sample tasks

### 5. **Output Deliverables**

- **New Agent Definitions**: Complete agent markdown files
- **Integration Guide**: How to use new agents effectively
- **Workflow Examples**: Sample usage patterns for your project
- **Tool Configuration**: Optimized tool settings for your codebase
- **Memory Templates**: Project-specific context and knowledge

### 6. **Follow-up Actions**

- Agent testing and validation
- Integration with existing workflow
- Performance monitoring and optimization
- Continuous improvement based on usage
