## Multi-Agent Feature Development

**Feature Request:** $ARGUMENTS

Execute comprehensive feature development using specialized agents for maximum efficiency and quality:

### 1. **Feature Analysis & Planning**

**Agent Team:**
- **micro-analyzer**: Analyze current codebase structure and identify integration points
- **api-designer**: Design API endpoints and data models if needed
- **security-auditor**: Assess security implications and requirements
- **perf-optimizer**: Evaluate performance impact and optimization opportunities

### 2. **Development Strategy**

**Phase 1: Analysis & Design**
- Codebase impact analysis using Serena semantic tools
- API design and data model planning
- Security and performance considerations
- Integration point identification

**Phase 2: Implementation Planning**
- File structure and organization
- Dependencies and package requirements
- Testing strategy and coverage
- Documentation requirements

**Phase 3: Development & Testing**
- Code implementation with best practices
- Unit and integration testing
- Security validation
- Performance optimization

### 3. **Agent Workflow**

1. **micro-analyzer** → Codebase analysis and integration planning
2. **api-designer** → API/interface design and data modeling
3. **security-auditor** → Security review and vulnerability assessment
4. **perf-optimizer** → Performance analysis and optimization
5. **micro-executor** → Implementation and testing execution

### 4. **Deliverables**

- **Feature Specification**: Detailed requirements and design
- **Implementation Plan**: Step-by-step development roadmap
- **Code Implementation**: Working feature with tests
- **Integration Guide**: How to integrate with existing codebase
- **Testing Results**: Validation and quality assurance
- **Documentation**: User and developer documentation

### 5. **Quality Gates**

- Code review and security validation
- Performance benchmarking
- Test coverage requirements
- Documentation completeness
- Integration testing success
