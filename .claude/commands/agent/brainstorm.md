## Multi-Agent Codebase Brainstorming

**Focus Area:** $ARGUMENTS

## Gemini MCP Capabilities

**Use Gemini MCP tools for advanced brainstorming analysis and creative problem solving:**

- **ask-gemini**: Advanced codebase analysis, complex improvement evaluation, and structured brainstorming recommendations with changeMode
- **brainstorm**: Creative improvement solutions, innovative development strategies, and collaborative ideation techniques
- Perfect for analyzing complex codebase requirements, generating efficient improvement strategies, and exploring creative enhancement patterns
- Use changeMode parameter with ask-gemini for structured code improvements and brainstorming suggestions
- These tools can save context usage by handling complex analysis and creative thinking efficiently

Launch a collaborative brainstorming session with specialized agents to generate innovative ideas:

### 1. **Brainstorming Team Assembly**

**Agent Selection Strategy:**

- **Primary Analyst**: micro-analyzer or semantic-navigator for codebase understanding
- **Creative Thinker**: api-designer or perf-optimizer for innovative solutions
- **Critical Evaluator**: security-auditor or micro-analyzer for feasibility assessment

**Dynamic Team Formation:**

- Select agents based on the specific focus area
- Ensure complementary skill sets for comprehensive analysis
- Balance technical depth with creative thinking

### 2. **Brainstorming Methodology**

**Phase 1: Discovery & Analysis**

- Codebase exploration using Serena semantic tools
- Pattern identification and architectural insights
- Current state assessment and pain point identification
- Opportunity mapping and improvement potential

**Phase 2: Ideation & Innovation**

- Divergent thinking for multiple solution approaches
- Cross-pollination of ideas between agents
- Feasibility assessment and technical validation
- Innovation prioritization and impact evaluation

**Phase 3: Synthesis & Action Planning**

- Idea consolidation and combination
- Implementation roadmap development
- Resource requirement estimation
- Success metrics and validation criteria

### 3. **Focus Areas & Agent Specialization**

**Architecture & Design:**

- micro-analyzer + api-designer + semantic-navigator
- Focus: Structural improvements, scalability, maintainability

**Performance & Optimization:**

- perf-optimizer + micro-analyzer + security-auditor
- Focus: Speed, efficiency, resource utilization
