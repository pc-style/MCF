## Context Merging Operation

**Contexts to Merge:** $ARGUMENTS

Intelligently merge the specified conversation contexts into a unified, optimized discussion:

### 1. **Context Analysis**
Analyze each context to understand:
- Core topics and discussion areas
- Key decisions and outcomes
- Technical implementations and configurations
- Project objectives and progress
- Dependencies and relationships

### 2. **Content Overlap Assessment**
Identify overlapping content across contexts:
- **Duplicate Information**: Same concepts explained multiple times
- **Redundant Examples**: Similar code or configuration examples
- **Repeated Decisions**: Same choices discussed in multiple contexts
- **Shared Dependencies**: Common tools, libraries, or configurations

### 3. **Chronological Integration**
Merge contexts while preserving logical timeline:
- Maintain sequence of decisions and their evolution
- Preserve cause-and-effect relationships
- Keep development progression intact
- Integrate related discussions chronologically

### 4. **Conflict Resolution**
Address inconsistencies between contexts:
- **Conflicting Decisions**: Identify and resolve contradictory choices
- **Version Differences**: Determine most current/accurate information
- **Approach Variations**: Reconcile different implementation approaches
- **Outdated Information**: Update superseded content with latest version

### 5. **Content Deduplication**
Eliminate redundant content while preserving value:
- Consolidate similar explanations into single, comprehensive versions
- Merge related code examples and remove duplicates
- Combine repetitive discussions into focused summaries
- Preserve unique insights while removing verbose repetition

### 6. **Topic Integration**
Organize merged content into logical topic flow:
- Group related discussions together
- Maintain natural progression between topics
- Preserve important context transitions
- Create coherent narrative from merged content

### 7. **Context Optimization**
Optimize the merged context for efficiency:
- Compress verbose explanations while preserving key information
- Streamline repetitive content patterns
- Focus on actionable information and clear decisions
- Remove tangential discussions that don't add value

### 8. **Quality Assurance**
Ensure merged context maintains high quality:
- Verify all important decisions are preserved
- Confirm technical accuracy across merged content
- Check that action items and next steps are clear
- Validate that merged context tells coherent story

### 9. **Integration Summary**
Provide summary of merge operation:
- What content was successfully merged
- How conflicts were resolved
- What redundant content was eliminated
- Overall improvement in context efficiency
- Key information preserved in the merged context
