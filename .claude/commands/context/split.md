## Context Topic Splitting

**Target Topics:** $ARGUMENTS

Split our current conversation into focused, topic-based contexts for better organization and efficiency:

### 1. **Topic Analysis**
Analyze our conversation to identify major discussion topics:
- Primary development tasks and features
- Configuration and setup work
- Documentation and research activities
- Debugging and troubleshooting sessions
- Planning and architectural discussions
- Security and performance considerations

### 2. **Content Categorization**
For each identified topic, categorize relevant content:
- **Essential Context**: Core information needed for the topic
- **Supporting Details**: Helpful background and explanations
- **Code Examples**: Implementations and configurations
- **Decisions Made**: Key choices and their reasoning
- **Action Items**: Tasks and next steps

### 3. **Topic-Specific Context Creation**
Create self-contained contexts for specified topics ($ARGUMENTS):

For each topic:
- Extract all relevant discussions and decisions
- Include necessary background and prerequisites
- Preserve important code and configuration examples
- Maintain logical flow and progression within the topic
- Include references to related topics when necessary

### 4. **Cross-Topic Dependencies**
Identify and document relationships between topics:
- Shared configurations or dependencies
- Decisions in one topic that affect others
- Code or components used across multiple topics
- Sequential dependencies (topic A must precede topic B)

### 5. **Context Optimization**
For each split context:
- Remove redundant explanations
- Compress verbose discussions while preserving key points
- Focus on actionable information and decisions
- Eliminate off-topic tangents and digressions

### 6. **Standalone Validation**
Ensure each split context is self-contained:
- All necessary background information is included
- References to external context are minimal and clear
- Each context can be understood independently
- Action items and next steps are clear within each topic

### 7. **Navigation Framework**
Create a navigation system between contexts:
- Overview of all split topics and their relationships
- Cross-references for shared information
- Guidelines for when contexts should be merged
- Instructions for maintaining consistency across topics

### 8. **Split Summary**
Provide a summary for each created context:
- Topic scope and focus area
- Key decisions and outcomes captured
- Important code or configurations included
- Recommended next steps within the topic
- Dependencies on other contexts

**Execute the context split now, creating focused contexts for each specified topic.**
