## Context Usage Analysis

Please provide a comprehensive analysis of our current context usage:

### 1. **Token Usage Estimation**
- Analyze the current conversation length
- Estimate approximate token consumption
- Identify the largest context consumers
- Highlight repetitive or redundant content patterns

### 2. **Conversation Health Metrics**
- Message count and average message length
- Complexity of discussions and code examples
- Number of different topics covered
- Context efficiency score (content value vs. token cost)

### 3. **Content Analysis**
- **High-Value Content**: Essential decisions, configurations, code
- **Medium-Value Content**: Useful explanations and examples  
- **Low-Value Content**: Redundant discussions, verbose explanations
- **Outdated Content**: Information superseded by newer decisions

### 4. **Context Optimization Opportunities**
- Content that could be compressed or summarized
- Repetitive patterns that could be deduplicated
- Verbose explanations that could be condensed
- Old discussions that could be archived

### 5. **Recommendations**

Based on the analysis, provide specific recommendations:

**Immediate Actions:**
- When to run `/context:purge` and with what focus areas
- Which topics could benefit from `/context:split`
- Whether any content should be bookmarked before changes

**Efficiency Strategies:**
- How to use subagents more effectively
- Which tasks should use `/context:agent` instead of main conversation
- Patterns to avoid in future conversations

**Usage Projections:**
- Estimated remaining conversation capacity
- Suggested checkpoint intervals for context management
- Long-term context strategy for this project

### 6. **Action Plan**

Provide a priority-ordered action plan for context optimization:
1. **Critical**: Actions needed immediately
2. **Important**: Actions that should be taken soon  
3. **Beneficial**: Optimizations that would help long-term
